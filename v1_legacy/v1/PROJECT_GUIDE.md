- Objects are detected automatically in real-time

## üìà Recommended Workflow

### For New Users:
1. **Start with basic detection**: `python object_detection_system.py`
2. **Clean your dataset**: `python class_cleaner.py`
3. **Try transfer learning**: `python run_transfer_learning.py`
4. **Use advanced detection**: `python transfer_learning_detector.py`

### For Advanced Users:
1. **Analyze current classes**: `python class_cleaner.py`

3. **Retrain with clean data**: `python trainer_v3.py` or `python run_transfer_learning.py`
4. **Deploy optimized model**: Use appropriate detector script

## üîç When to Use Each Approach

### Original Educational Model (`object_detection_system.py`)
‚úÖ **Use when**:
- You have limited computational resources
- You only need educational objects
- You want faster inference
- You're working in controlled classroom environments

‚ùå **Don't use when**:
- You need to detect general objects (people, furniture, etc.)
- You want maximum accuracy across diverse environments

### Transfer Learning Model (`transfer_learning_detector.py`)
‚úÖ **Use when**:
- You need comprehensive object detection
- You want better generalization
- You're working in diverse environments

## üéØ Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Clean your dataset first**: Use `class_cleaner.py` to remove ~60% of irrelevant classes
2. **Remove metadata**: Use `remove_metadata_classes.py` for Roboflow datasets
3. **Use transfer learning**: Better accuracy with `run_transfer_learning.py`
4. **Adjust confidence threshold**: Modify in detector scripts for your needs
5. **Optimize for your environment**: Retrain with your specific classroom data
